  <div id="abt_desc" class="cont">
    <h2 class="cont_h">REFLECTING BACK:</h2>
    <p id="abt_desc" class="desc"><b>Why did you join LeADERS?</b> I knew of the LeADERS program when I first started at ODU, but it never occurred to me to join until I heard about the Cyber LeADERS program that was in conjunction with the DOD Scholarship for Service Program. I wasn't able to apply for that, but I still kept pursuing a LeADERS path. I came on late, sure, but that didn't stop me since I had flexibility in my major to make room for LeADERS-centric classes such as CPD 412. Ironically enough, though, with my interdisciplinary major, I was fulfilling LeADERS objectives already! This proves the extreme flexibility this program offers and that anyone can participate- no matter when they join.</p>
    <p id="abt_desc" class="desc"><b>What significant challenges did you encounter throughout your LeADERS courses and related experiences? How did you overcome these challenges?</b> I feel like one challenge was taking CPD 412, leadership and law. At the time, it had no prequisites; although looking back, a lot of us taking it thought it should have. For one, it required us to legal writing for some assignments and case analysis- something I was fortunate enough to know, but not so much the others. I still got a good grade in the class, but I didn't really feel very fulfilled taking it, perhaps because I didn't know what to expect- I didn't plan on taking it fully to learn about business and employer law; However, if I do want to go to law school or work as a cyber professional, this type of law is one that is very important to have foundational knowledge about. My other 3 classes I had no issues with. I would recommend for CPD 412 that is be taken if you have foundational legal knowledge unless they add a prequisite class such as CRJS 262, Law and the Criminal Justive System.</p>
    <p id="abt_desc" class="desc"><b>What significant successes did you have during your LeADERS courses and related experiences? What contributed to your successes?</b> This program helped me understand that leadership isn't contained in one area. It has multiple areas that can be connected to different disciplines to make a strong, multi-fauceted leader. I had my first internship while taking CYSE 368 and learned to reflect on my experiences and learn from them- somthing all leaders need to grow and succeed. I learned how to research in SOC 337, a <i>social</i> research methods class to not only learn how to research, but research using methods to better understand those I work with and for. I learned interdisciplinary writing in IDS 300W which helped me better understand my interdisciplinary major and helped me write my best paper yet, combining technology and legal perspectives into one. These skills have helped me develop into a better and more thoughtful leader in addition to making the most of my degree. I am endlessly grateful.</p>
    <p id="abt_desc" class="desc"><b>How do you see all of your specific LeADERS experiences connecting to one another?</b> I mostly see these experiences aligning to my degree's concept of interdisciplinarity. All my courses aligned with my degree plan, too, which was very fortunate for me. I first took SOC 337 as a requirement for my major to learn methods of research potentially useful to my field and to help make me a better researcher. I followed that with my internship class, CYSE 368, where I put those research skills to use and picked up skills in technical writing and policy analysis. I followed that with IDS 300W, the interdisciplinary theory and research class required for my major that really pushed me to write my best paper yet on the Fourth Amendment and Technology. I finished up my LeADERS curriculum with CPD 412 which, I don't feel was super beneficial to my repertoire but to a degree still helped me gain a better understanding of the business sector that I'll probably have to deal with one day. Overall, it all pieces together with my curriculum to help paint the bigger picture of my improvement throughout my college career.</p>
    <h2 class="cont_h">LOOKING FORWARD:</h2>
    <p id="abt_desc" class="desc">Regarding relevance to my future, I believe this has helped prepare me for the potential paths I may take. As of right now, I am considering law school and I feel it is a challenge I can take on thanks to the LeADERS classes I took. I've become not only a better writer and researcher, but a confident one with style. Currently, I work on ships but I still have to research and write. In some aspects, there are moments where I can be a leader, trying to drive change when possible. Other times, I still work in Civil Air Patrol with 100+ cadets now as a leader and a teacher. It's difficult, but rewarding. ALl of my roles were shaped by the LeADERS program and my degree. I Think ODU is very unqiue in having this program and it helps set us a part from the rest.</p>

    <h2 class="cont_h">LEADERSHIP: CPD 412: Leadership And Law</h2>
    <p class="desc">"This course addresses leadership in public, private, and non-profit organizations relative to laws that impact such organizations. Students will examine their role as leaders within legal systems that influence business operations such as employment law, intellectual property, antitrust, white collar crime, and bankruptcy."</p>
    <p class="desc">In this class we briefly studied the personal leadership philospphy and ethical code before proceeding to business law concepts. We did not cover antitrust, white collar crime, and bankruptcy. I believe the main purpose of this course was to prepare employers to be properly prepared for their business venture in the legal sense. I nonetheless believe this course was helpful in fulfilling my law interests and the legal business perspective that can also be considered in private sector cybersecurity situations. We mostly read about business law basics from the employer perspective. I appreciate the experiences this class gave me, especially given this class required me to exercise my case law analysis skills which I've been working on my own. I chose OSHA for my project selection as I've worked in the food industry and felt an obligation to know more about OSHA regulatoins.</p>
    <p class='desc'>I realized that business is, still, something I'm not interested in- and that's okay! Also that I am not a fan of 8-week async. classes.. It was also challenging given that for most of the students in the class had no legal research background and this class, despite no pre-requisites, required case law knowledge and research. I was lucky having that experience, though. The skills I learned from this class I know will help me in the future if I am to ever work in or with the private sector side of cybersecurity and to understand the legal view of the employer.</p>

    <p class="desc">12-weeks in length covering topics such as: Cyber Threat Hunting, System Information Event Management (SIEM) solutions, Splunk Enterprise, the Risk Management Framework, and other federal frameworks for cybersecurity (DODI 8500.01, SECNAV 5239.3, NIST SP 800-53, etc.)
For this class students are required to complete reflection journals every 50 hours of work and ultimately a final paper covering the internship experience.
In my internship I also wrote a whitepaper for NSWC Corona.</p>
    <p class="desc">This internship helped me put my foot in the door for my future career, now working in the Navy as a contractor on ships to help the mission succee and ensure ships are cyber compliant. It was difficult to really get in the groove of things at first since I didn't have a lot of tasking, especially now with my new job, but I learned then to use time to my advantage and learn things that would be beneficial to my career or position. A lot of this and my next internship was downtime with minimal tasking. It was vital for my own sanity to keep moving along with <i>something</i>. I know now to never waste a second in this life- a second can set us back days or weeks, who knows. Make every moment count.</p>
    <p class="desc">Since I worked 300+ hours, I completed 6 Reflection Journals and a Final Paper. Below are all my journals succeeded by my final paper.</p>

    <h2 class="cont_h">RESEARCH: SOC 337: SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODS</h2>
    <h3 class="cont_desc">WHAT DO SOCIAL SCIENTISTS KNOW ABOUT CRIME?</h3>
    <p class="desc">In this class I learned social research methods; specifically, quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. I never took statistics courses,
so quantitative research was a new challenge. Nonetheless, I persevered and was able to use these methods to conduct social research through projects assigned by our professor. These methods and tools are used by social scientists conducting social research to help organize data quantitative and or qualitatively. While I often do not come across situations where quantitative analysis is needed, I use qualitative methods more and learned the concept of ‘coding’. Coding requires examining sources and finding ‘snippets’ of information containing a keyword or phrase in relation to the research question/topic. Then, analysis of those snippets together into several
categories or ‘codes’ to act as topics covered in research. I found this method to be very helpful in engaging with my sources, analyzing them, and integrating them into an overall perspective.</p>
      <p class="desc">For our final, we wrote a qualitative analysis paper on pre-selected topics and sources. Ironically enough, my topic aligned with technology, precisely the viewpoint of technology at the turn of the century. We were to analyze our sources and come up with 3 codes to write a detailed analysis on the topic. Overall, this method of research was challenging enough to be very engaging and rewarding. Knowing how to conduct both these types of research have not only diversified my research toolset, but how I approach and plan my projects. I highly recommend people take this course, especially with Dr. Graham!</p>

    <h2 class="cont_h">WRITING: IDS 300W: Interdisciplinary Theory and Concepts</h2>
    <h3 class="cont_desc">Paper on "Reasonable Expectation of Privacy and Corporate-Issued Mobile Devices for Public and Government Employees"</h3>
    <p class="desc">An examination of the history, concepts and application of interdisciplinary study. This course includes an analysis of similarities and differences in academic disciplines and the application of interdisciplinary approaches to a specific topic of study. Applying the concepts of the Interdisciplinary Research Process (IRP) to our final paper was the end goal of this course. It really helped me become a better researcher while gaining a clearer undertanding of the importance of interdisciplinarity. Ultimately, this course helped me take a step back to understand my major from a different perspective- that it wasn't just "cybersecurity + criminal justice" it was a <i>blend</i> of both into something new and wonderful.</p>
    <p class="desc">I can't lie in saying that this class at first was challenging. I was already using an interdisciplinary mindset given my major but it was difficult.. re-learning it in a formal way. I suppose it's like we are born and raised on our native language and then we learn it formally in school and it's a certain type of "difficult" per se. A feeling we don't experience often. As we finished our readings on interdisciplinary theory and writing, though, approaching a more wholesome understanding of the concept and putting words to things I knew of but didn't quite have a name for was another satisfying feeling. I worked really hard on my research paper for the class as I learned how to formally apply these concepts. It really helped me understand perspectives from other discplines more.</p>
    <p class="desc">I took this class in tandem with CRJS 497: Independent Study. The paper I wrote for that course, with permission of both professors, I modified and submitted for this course since it utilized an interdisciplinary approach. I hope in the future I can use this strengthened skill to write more papers on cybersecurity and law!</p>

    <h2 class="cont_h">EPORTFOLIO: IDS 493: IDS Electronic Portfolio Project</h2>
    <h3 class="cont_desc">"An interactive living portal." - Celeste Nguyen</h3>
    <p class="desc">This class is required for all cybersecurity majors as well as IDS majors such as myself. I highly recommend to anyone to take this with Dr. Virginia Tucker; she brings this class to life despite it being fully asynchronous. I can definitely say this was a "best class for last" situation. I recount in my reflective essay that constructing an eportfolio is something that is wholesomely reflective on one's college journey (in this case). To look back and compose a timeline of the classes we've taken and derive three types of skills we've learned along the way: critical thinking, research and writing, and technical skills.</p>
    <p class="desc">Most classes have you read a text book or a chunk of articles. Here, we examined a variety of mixed media covering eportfolios and related literature to help not only build an eportfolio for the class, but understand the history and current literature surrounding it. Why it works, how it works, how good ones are made, etc. Learning that something like an eportfolio isn't just a "one and done" type of deal, but it's "living"; a look back on our time in college or our careers. Often we finish classes and sweep them under the rug of forgetting, moving on to the next challenge. This is not just a class, it's an experience that has changed how I view my work. It brought me back to when I was in art school as a child where we kept portfolios of our work and often looked through them. This taught me to take time to look back at my work over my journey and take pride in how far I've come but value all the work along the way because without it I wouldn't be who I am today.</p>
    <p class="desc">Below are the two most impactful writing assignments I've written in this course- and probably in a while. Our Personal Narrative assignment got me to really look back at my life in a different perspective that ultimately set me up for the Reflection paper. I really suggest, again, everyone take this class with Dr. Tucker if possible! She challenges you in a way you didn't think you needed.</p>
