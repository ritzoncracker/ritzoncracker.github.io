        <h3 class="cont_desc">In IDS 493, we are required to look back on our college career and reflect on the skills we've gained from the classes we've taken over the years. To create a wholesome understanding of our college career from identifying 3 skills we've derived. I identified Technical, Critical Thinking, and Writing and Research as three skills I learned throughout my journey.</h3>

        <h2 id="Technical" class="cont_h">Technical Skills</h>
        <h3 class="cont_desc">Perhaps the most expected skill any cyber major is to build upon, I definitely strengthened my technical skills throughout the course of my degree. Technical skills are typically the center focus of most occupations such as a cybersecurity engineer or penetration tester. Only when I began my second year of studies at ODU was when I began to build upon technical skills in my field. Even then, the coursework I had would not be enough to make me competitive with my peers, so it took outside learning to shorten gaps I my knowledge such as networking and studying for certifications like Security+ and CySA+. Many challenges were encountered on the way, but the following three courses were what drove my technical skills development: IT 205, a course in objected oriented programming in Java; CYSE 301, a beginner course in cybersecurity operations and techniques; and CYSE 407, a course in techniques in digital forensics.

        <h2 id="CT" class="cont_h">Critical Thinking Skills</h>
        <h3 class="cont_desc">Aligning with the ability to be independent, critical thinking in any situation is a must. It demonstrates one’s ability to make complex decisions from understanding and analyzing elements of a situation. It is important to demonstrate this skill as opposed to simply saying you have it. Throughout my college career in my interdisciplinary major, I have had plenty of opportunities to grow my critical thinking skills and take them to new heights. I have been able to demonstrate this growth in three classes: POLS 101S, an introduction to American Politics; CRJS 421, a class on deviant behavior from the criminological and sociological perspectives; and IDS300W, a class on interdisciplinary theory and concepts.

        <h2 id="W&R" class="cont_h">Writing and Research Skills</h>
        <h3 class="cont_desc">Writing and research are imperative skills to the collegiate toolset, as the basis of any bachelorette program is to learn how to research. However, not everyone is a great researcher. Many classes helped me grow this skill; however, I would attest my growth in writing mostly to three classes: CRJS 497, an independent studies course in criminal justice; CYSE 368, a cybersecurity internship course; and SOC 337, a course in sociology research methods. In each of these classes I produced an end-product paper that accumulated the entirety of my learning.
